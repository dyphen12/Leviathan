# Leviathan

## A Cryptocurrencies Trading Software with ANN predictions. 

(This version is only for Bitcoin and Ethereum on Binance)

A couple of deep learning models applied to stock market prediction and their facilities.

Models up:

EVA-01: A Recurrent Neural Network for pattern analysis.
EVA-Prototype3: Long-Short Term Memory Neural Network for patterns in time analysis.

# How's work?

Get the Git and run a Neural Network model on the load module.
The models listed and their respective data for training are in Fortune Tellers.

# How to use it?

Run atenea.py

It going to show you the execution of all the modules for Bitcoin prediction.


# What's like this?

Because was just and Experiment. I'm going to Upload a more friendly version on another git.

## A little description:

atenea.py It's the main program, a Ticker with a prediction with the function of execute an Market strategy on binance (you should put it yourself on the code)

Asukav2.py It's the API integration of the ANN's and the data retrieved by the web and the program itself.
